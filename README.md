# Welcome to the Daml Online Shop example!
## Getting started
To run the app do:
1. Regenerate the bindings via `exec/regenerateBindings`
1. Start the sandbox via `exec/startSandbox`
1. Start the background task via `application/exec/start`
1. Download the deps, build & start the UI via this single command `ui/exec/quickstart`

In the last step a browser window should have opened with the online shop being displayed.
Have fun!
